# Usage

The README covers the basics. This page collects the
longer examples and the notes that did not fit up front.

## Basic

```bash
# show what would be cleaned, change nothing
logwash ./logs --older-than 30 --dry-run

# archive logs older than 30 days
logwash ./logs --older-than 30 --archive ./backup
```

## Notes

- Dry-run mode shows what would happen, touches nothing
- Archive matched logs into a timestamped .tar.gz
